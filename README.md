Javascript Test

TEST NAME: Todo list


Problem statement
Create a simple Todo list with vanilla JS (as you see in the GIF below). Vanilla JS means no plugins, no libraries, nothing.

Instructions
You are ALLOWED to style the todo list the way you like. Do whatever you want with the styling.
You are ALLOWED to google and read how to approach the problem.
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet.

Hosting on Github is compulsory, I will be rejecting the submission if not hosted!


Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)
A minimal design with HTML and CSS, it should look nice (no libraries, no frameworks).
A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items)
Total number of tasks in the list.
Extra points for creativity (think about user accessibility, some animations and things like that)
